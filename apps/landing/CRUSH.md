# Landing Site Guidelines (Astro)

## Objective
This is our new landing site for `www.amaxaimpact.org`, it uses Astro and is a read-only site with a blog. This is going to be a new optimized codebase that will remove tech debt and improve performance. It's in the process of being migrated from /apps/website.

## Novice-Friendly Codebase
This codebase in particular is where you need to be careful, it will be modified by members of our team who are not technical with AI tools. 
- **Break things down and make them very easy to read.**
- **Don't obfuscate a lot of complex logic because novices will be working on this.**
- The old website is shit and filled with bloated code. We need to clean it up and make it more maintainable in the new landing site.
