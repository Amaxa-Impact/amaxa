  Her team planted three trees native to their communities in the US, Vietnam, and Turkey.  They completed measurements on the tree, and started the process of calculating the CO2 sequestration.

  Guided by their coach, they implemented the project management techniques ámaxa developed based on 2 years of research and project iterations.

      `
  By meeting remotely every week for 3 months, they raised the funds to purchase the seedlings for each tree. Then, they identified a suitable place to plant it. Finally, they measured the tree and calculated the CO2 each sequesters.

      '"Change, in any capacity, can and should start with us." -Isabella',
      `
  Through ámaxa’s student impact fellowship, and a partnership with the nonprofit Gaza Champions, Isabella, Zobia, and their program coach Delilah created Alliance Academy’s first “Melody of Alliance Fall Charity Concert”. After being told that the brainstormed event could happen in just two weeks, the team jumped into action. They had spent the few weeks prior getting an idea of their timeline based on their before-winter-break goal and now they’d met a crunch point where all tasks were vital to make the concert the best it could be. Isabella and Zobia worked together in and outside of the weekly meetings arranged by their coach to contact sponsors for the event’s raffle, create awesome marketing material, and make sure everything was approved by school authority. At the event, they had 20 attendants, 3 raffle prizes awarded, and almost $200 USD raised. The team reflected that they believe that they did an awesome job with the limited job they were given. A huge takeaway was to focus on what you are in control of.
