            We are launching a new pathway to build a grassroots research
            capacity that will support and amplify work of our partner
            nonprofits.
          </h2>

          <p class="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            This pathway is designed for intellectually curious undergraduate
            students eager to finetune their research skills and for Masters or
            PhD students who are eager to utilise their research skills to
            effect tangible social change.
          </p>

          <p class="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            Our mission is to conduct, write, and publish original research on
            questions critical to work of our partner nonprofits and
            initiatives. Short-term objectives are to identify gaps in research
            pertaining to our 9 projects and their related topics and conduct
            research over 3-6 months. At a minimum, your work will be published
            on the ámaxa site, as we aim for our site to grow as a resource for
            robust non-academic research. However, we have already begun work to
            partner with academics who can offer mentorship in publishing ámaxa
            research pieces on think tanks, media outlets, and peer-reviewed
            journals. A long-term objective of this pathway is to conduct field
            research at sites of our partners in Uganda, Liberia,
            Poland/Ukraine, and Palestine.
          </p>

          <p class="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
            As this is a new pathway, we will accept applications on a rolling
            basis and reach out to applicants if we believe it will be a good
            fit.
