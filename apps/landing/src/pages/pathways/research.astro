              This pathway is designed for intellectually curious undergraduate
              students eager to finetune their research skills and for Masters
              or PhD students who are eager to utilise their research skills to
              effect tangible social change.

              Our mission is to conduct, write, and publish original research on
              questions critical to work of our partner nonprofits and
              initiatives. Short-term objectives are to identify gaps in
              research pertaining to our 9 projects and their related topics and
              conduct research over 3-6 months. At a minimum, your work will be
              published on the ámaxa site, as we aim for our site to grow as a
              resource for robust non-academic research. However, we have
              already begun work to partner with academics who can offer
              mentorship in publishing ámaxa research pieces on think tanks,
              media outlets, and peer-reviewed journals. A long-term objective
              of this pathway is to conduct field research at sites of our
              partners in Uganda, Liberia, Poland/Ukraine, and Palestine.
