          "Amaxa’s initiative with Nyaka focuses on attaining solar lights for “grannies” (female matriarchs, caretakers, and leaders) in rural Uganda. Why grannies? “Effects from the HIV/AIDS crisis are still felt in Uganda today. And extreme poverty continues to destabilize families and put children at risk.” (Nyaka) These issues have created many orphans, and that’s where grandmothers come in. “These women step up for the sake of their communities, knowing they play a key role in strengthening the future of all families.” (Nyaka) However, when the sun goes down activities like weaving and doing homework become difficult in areas without electricity. ",
          "Our initiative with Nyaka helps to combat this issue, while encouraging education, financial stability, and climate protection. This initiative truly shows how social issues are oftentimes intricately interwoven with one another. We are proud to work with Nyaka and to learn from the deep understanding of place, culture and community that guides their innovative changemaking. ",

Since Russia's unjust full-scale invasion in 2022 and the war that has followed, civilians have not only had to worry about shelling and invading forces, but also about food and medicine shortages. This is especially true for those living near the frontlines. Although many Ukrainians have relocated, or fled the country as refugees, some have not been able to leave. For example, many elderly Ukrainians have opted to stay in their homes, as moving is simply not an option for them due to age. ",

Our teams help with digital fundraising and marketing campaigns, while also fundraising in their communities.

          "The Feminist Library Project is centered on representation and education, and is also one of ámaxa’s newest projects. ámaxa teams will begin by researching and creating a reading list to work with. The reading list will be comprehensive. For younger children, the goal is simply to find books that feature multifaceted girls in positions of empowerment, while also pushing back against some of the damaging narratives that girls are all too often introduced to at a young age. For example, Gertrude McFuzz by Dr. Seuss follows a bird who wishes she could look “more beautiful” by having more feathers. As the story progresses, she realizes that having more feathers infringes on some of her previous abilities and her interactions with others. It’s a great story to start dispelling negative beauty standards for younger readers. For older readers, the list may delve into works that are not only narratives, but also social commentary. The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood is a well-known example that would be on this portion of the list.",
          "After the list has been created, edited, and finalized, ámaxa teams will engage in book collection. Teams may fundraise in order to purchase the books, organize book drives, or even venture out to thrift stores and libraries in their communities to find pre-loved books that can be reused for the project. Once the ámaxa feminist library is large enough in size, we will open up a signup form on the ámaxa website. There schools can sign up to receive a book box, with a curated selection of books for their school library. ",
          "Ultimately, our goal is to empower students with knowledge. Reading not only fosters learning and understanding of the world but also broadens horizons, introducing diverse cultures, perspectives, and ideas. If the books we donate to schools inspire even one young girl to recognize her potential and see herself as the protagonist of her own story, then the library will have achieved its purpose.",

By doing the work to learn which trees maximize carbon sequestration, we can help slow down the climate change crisis.",

They then plant them in their local communities – this makes our forest truly global: we have trees in Vietnam, California, the UAE and Turkey! Once trees are planted, ámaxa teams measure the carbon sequestration of the trees they plant. This allows us to learn more about which trees are most helpful to the climate. ",

The center aims at strengthening the educational capabilities and skills of students of different age categories through a variety of specialized training courses in fields like languages, social media, planning, and arts. It also aims to enhance youth engagement in their communities through organizing voluntary initiatives and interventions in different localities. ",
          "Although ámaxa has been working with ISNAD from its very first cohort, we strongly believe that the partnership is more important today than ever. Due to the Israeli occupation, most Palestinians can’t travel outside of Palestine. This, in conjunction with the war currently going on, has made many Palestinian students feel more isolated than ever. It has also made consistent, high-quality education a struggle, as the unpredictability of war affects every aspect of students’ lives. ",
          "ámaxa works with Isnad to connect Palestinian students with other students from around the globe. These connections not only help Palestinian students feel a bit less isolated, but also help ámaxa students get a clearer understanding of what Palestinians are going through, and the gravity of the situation there. Students in the past have helped teach English to students, increase the community center’s presence on social media, and worked to create Accesifyed: an interactive website to host custom English lessons for Palestinian students.",

We are seeing more LGBTQ+ stories told than ever before, and the industry has continued to crack its gates open more widely for LGBTQ+ artists, but there is still much work to be done. Anyone in the art and entertainment industry will tell you that getting funding is hard. However, getting funding for, let’s say, a gay miniseries, or a trans romantic novel, is even harder. Studios, publishing houses, and execs still see these stories as ‘risky.’ Furthermore, LGBTQ+ artists themselves can have a harder time getting their foot, and therefore their art, inside the door. Without funding, everything else becomes harder too, including PR and marketing. ",

This program is a way for ámaxa to help LGBTQ+ artists and storytellers get the attention they deserve, while also allowing us to give our students tangible experience in their fields of interests. Through the application (which will be posted on our website prior to each cycle) LGBTQ+ artists and storytellers can apply to be our next feature artist. If selected, they will benefit from the help of our team of young professionals and marketing and PR students. From social media management and content creation, to pitch decks, to garnering publicity, the ámaxa team will work in alignment with the artist to promote and empower.",

All art, and all artists, should be given equal opportunities to exist, create, and work – that’s what this project stands for. ",

It is simply too complicated for people who are struggling to access the information and resources they need. The information is out there, but it is split between numerous websites and numerous pages on those websites. A person shouldn’t have to click 50 times to get a comprehensive list of resources available and/or local to them. That’s where the first aspect of the MHFA project comes into play. ámaxa teams are working to compile a comprehensive database of mental health resources at the country, state and local level. The goal is to have a comprehensive database where, no matter where you are located, you can find help, resources, and community.",
          "Relevance is also a struggle. Lighting a candle o r listening to happy music is not an effective solution for someone suffering from a panic attack, for example. This is where the second aspect of the MHFA project is introduced: a mental health first aid course. The goal is to have a course that draws a line between the self-care practices that have been popularized in popular culture and mental health first aid, while also recognizing the intersectionality of the two. ámaxa teams are conducting outreach and interviews with leaders in the field of youth mental health. Conversations with these researchers and educators will form the backbone of the mental health course we hope to develop and implement in schools worldwide. Our vision is to bring mental health education and practices into classrooms, clubs and more through peer to peer conversation, teaching and learning!",

I really like how this project is conveying that spreading awareness is just not enough in order for people to truly understand mental illness.” -Summer 2024 Student on our MHFA team`,

As a result, many schools closed, and many of the schools that stayed open are concentrated in urban areas. Now take all of those damaging factors, and add in cost.

One year of tuition is only $80, and we don’t want financial costs to be the reason any child does not receive an education.",

Other groups have contributed to digital marketing efforts by creating content and working on a newsletter. All ámaxa students that work with Educate Children come away from the experience with not only transferable skills, (marketing, content creation, teamwork, organization, event planning, etc.) but also a greater knowledge of the world around them, and an enhanced understanding of education issues around the globe.
