# Empowerment Through Education: An Impactful Project to Help Palestine

The Palestinian-Israeli conflict is more than a conflict of nations- it is a story of innocent people grappling with the harsh realities of war and displacement. Civilians in Palestine are being killed, displaced, and deprived of their basic rights.

One of those rights that was seized from them is the right to education. Students and teachers risk tear gas, raids, armed clashes, arrest, and intimidation just by going to school.

But amidst this turmoil there is a glimmer of hope. The ISNAD Community Education Center gives students the opportunity to learn by doing through field trips, summer camps, and extracurricular activities. This gives students a place where they can find respite and learn.

## **The War’s Impact On Education**

Beyond the staggering statistics of attacks on Palestinian people lies an often-overlooked casualty—education. When Palestinians struggle everyday to survive, education is easily overlooked. The occupation’s ripple effects extend into the very fabric of how students and teachers engage with education.

Many times students and teachers have to choose between safety and education. Between 2015 and 2019, over 4,000 Palestinian students and educators were reportedly harmed by attacks – the highest number of worldwide attacks during the period (GCPEA). These attacks, all occurring near schools, include armed clashes, the use of tear gas, raids, checkpoints near schools, settler violence, and arrest and intimidation of children and teachers.

### The Occupation’s Impact on Students

Arrests, demolitions, and violence are all horrifically traumatizing experiences that Palestinians are forced to endure. When students regularly regulate trauma their minds are somewhere else instead of the classroom. Persistent memories of incidents can impede the students’ ability to focus on the content and engage in the classroom.

For students who arrive at school in spite of Israeli-imposed obstacles, they encounter an ever-increasing ratio of students to teachers due to students only being able to attend their local schools. Trauma, coupled with a large student to teacher ratio, makes school an overwhelming, not fun, experience for students.

### The Occupations Impact on Teachers

This barrage of challenges makes teaching distracted students a challenge. Teachers have to focus on teaching the bare minimum content of the textbook to simply get through a course. They have limited opportunities to use a variety of methods, such as discussion, collaborative work, and project-based activities.

These are the activities that make school fun and the material memorable. By only teaching by the textbook teachers can feel demotivated to teach, which can lead to poorer teaching experiences.

## The Need For Experiential Learning For Palestinian Students

Students remember best when they learn by doing, also known as experiential learning. Field trips, discussions, projects, lab experiments, volunteering, and internships all create experiences students will forever remember, hence the name experiential learning.

Students develop leadership, confidence, cultural awareness, decision-making, organization, civic engagement, and more essential life skills when they engage in experiential learning. Experiential learning not only helps the students remember school material, but teaches them essential life skills.

### ISNAD provides experimental learning opportunities

Amidst all of the struggles of education in Palestine there’s an organization providing much needed experiential learning opportunities for students. ISNAD Community Education Center in Dahria enhances youth engagement by organizing voluntary initiatives, field trips, summer camps, and courses in languages, arts, and more not available in local schools. This

### In-Person Experiential Learning Palestine Project

At ISNAD, qualified teachers provide a variety of learning opportunities for students. Students expand their educational abilities through classes in areas like languages, social media, planning, and arts. Students also participate in various volunteer projects and interventions in their local community.

ISNAD has organized more than 15 field trips since its founding just over three years ago. On these trips students can feel they are explorers, free to journey to an unknown site and take in all it has to teach them. For many, due to Israeli restrictions on movement, this is a feeling they have never experienced before.

### Online Experiential Learning Project in Palestine

Checkpoints and unreasonable permit regulations restrict students from meeting with others from outside their cities. At the same time, the occupation makes it very difficult for international visitors to enter Palestine. As a result Palestinians have very few opportunities to meet, conversate with, and learn from people from outside Palestine.

Through INSAD, Palestinians practice their English with volunteers from all over the world. They engage in conversations about food, music, film, pop culture, dress, traditions, and holidays. Through these activities English shifts from a bore to a lively exchange of ideas and experiences
