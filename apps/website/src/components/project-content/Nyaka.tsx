                  Nyaka provides community-based solutions to address the needs
                  of orphaned and vulnerable children in rural southwestern
                  Uganda. They surround each child with a comprehensive support
                  system of interrelated programs developed and led by the
                  community.

                  Amaxa’s initiative with Nyaka focuses on attaining solar
                  lights for “grannies” (female matriarchs, caretakers, and
                  leaders) in rural Uganda. Why grannies? “Effects from the
                  HIV/AIDS crisis are still felt in Uganda today. And extreme
                  poverty continues to destabilize families and put children at
                  risk.” (Nyaka) These issues have created many orphans, and
                  that’s where grandmothers come in. “These women step up for
                  the sake of their communities, knowing they play a key role in
                  strengthening the future of all families.” (Nyaka) However,
                  when the sun goes down activities like weaving and doing
                  homework become difficult in areas without electricity.

                  Our initiative with Nyaka helps to combat this issue, while
                  encouraging education, financial stability, and climate
                  protection. This initiative truly shows how social issues are
                  oftentimes intricately interwoven with one another. We are
                  proud to work with Nyaka and to learn from the deep
                  understanding of place, culture and community that guides
                  their innovative changemaking.
