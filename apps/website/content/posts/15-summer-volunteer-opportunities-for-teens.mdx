Summer is the perfect time for volunteering as more students are free, and there are plenty of opportunities available that serve everyone's interests. Are you passionate about sustainable fashion? Helping refugees? What about taking care of animals? There's definitely a nonprofit you could join to help any of these causes- and more! Volunteering also allows you to use your skills for a meaningful purpose. You can teach your skills to others or use them to support nonprofits locally and all over the world.
