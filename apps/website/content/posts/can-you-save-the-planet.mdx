What's happening to our planet right now?

The planet is currently facing a wide range of environmental factors that have significant impacts on the health and well-being of all living creatures. The most commonly discussed challenge is climate change, but there are a large number of issues that are being neglected. Some of these include the loss of biodiversity, pollution, deforestation, and resource depletion. Most of these issues are caused by human life and the changes we have made to Earth.
