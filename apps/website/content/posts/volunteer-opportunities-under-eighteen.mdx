If you feel drawn towards education, you can use your skills as an educated student to mentor and tutor younger kids. As a high school student, most schools and programs are excited to have someone come and help with elementary-level children. Volunteer opportunities for those interested in education can be found at community centers, after-school programs, youth organizations, literacy programs, summer camps, online platforms, and most importantly, local schools. Getting involved in education not only empowers students to make a positive impact on a child's life, but also provides valuable skills, broadens perspectives, and instills a sense of empathy and social responsibility.

For those interested in the environment, there are plenty of environmental initiatives available to students. This could be anything from joining beach cleanup groups to volunteering at environmental organizations or local government agencies. Other initiatives for individuals under 18 include tree planting projects, helping at community gardens, recycling and waste reduction, river and waterway cleanup groups, and habitat restoration projects.

Volunteering at hospitals and nursing homes as an individual under 18 years old can be a rewarding and impactful experience. If you feel drawn towards the medical profession or helping sick patients, this is a great path to explore. Hospitals and nursing homes offer various volunteer roles for high school students: preparing and delivering meals and refreshments for patients, assisting with administrative tasks, providing friendship and entertainment for the residents, organizing recreational activities, and supporting the other staff with non-medical duties.

## Learning for all Ages – Libraries and Museums

If you feel drawn towards a future in politics, government, or law, you might want to consider volunteering at a political campaign. Even if you are not old enough to vote, you can still participate in political campaigns. While some specific tasks may require older volunteers, common roles for high school students include canvassing neighborhoods, making phone calls, entering voter data into computers, distributing campaign materials, or even engaging in social media outreach.

## Animals – Animal Shelters
