![The Problem with the Extracurricular Gap](https://i.ibb.co/YfzgqvZ/Opinion-Christina-Carlson-May16.png)

Many of us grew up participating in extracurricular activities! They had a meaningful impact on our development, they made us responsible, and for many of us, it was a way to find our passions. But this is not a universal experience because many children can't afford to participate in extracurricular activities. Underprivileged kids then find themselves at a greater disadvantage because they lack the experience needed for college applications, meaning their options remain limited.

The extracurricular gap is the gap between students with higher-income parents who have access to more extracurriculars than those with lower-income parents. Consequently, those with access to more activities often have better opportunities throughout their life. An article published by [SAGE Journal](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0002716214548398?journalCode=annarevealed) says that "Participation in extracurricular activities is associated with positive youth outcomes such as higher education attainment and greater future earnings." Upper-middle-class students have parents who can afford these activities and all the expenses associated with them.

Income is a high determining factor in our access to opportunities in most cases. Think about it– in the US a typical parent spends $693 per year on each child's extracurriculars. This amount may reach $12,000 for children enrolled in elite programs like lacrosse, tennis, or ice hockey which require expensive equipment, uniforms, and specialized coaches.

Okay, but what about volunteering? Volunteering can be more accessible but it still contributes to the gap. Depending on where you live, there may not be enough volunteering opportunities available, or your parents' schedules may not be flexible enough, making them ultimately inaccessible.

Moreover, an article by [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/01/the-activity-gap/384961/) showed that a lack of extracurriculars increases children's exposure to hardships associated with low-income status, such as violence or unstable households.

Upper-middle-class students end up with more extracurriculars on their CVs as a result of this gap, meaning they have stronger profiles for applications to university, internships, and scholarships. Furthermore, they develop soft skills that prepare them for careers. They are also exposed to positive role models who inspire them set goals.

Extracurriculars play a very important role in admissions. Two kids may have the same scores, but the one that has more extracurriculars is more likely to get accepted because extracurriculars allow one to demonstrate the qualities of a well-rounded person. Although this makes sense, these standards oftentimes perpetuate socio-economic inequality. Yet, this is not a problem with the university evaluation system but rather with the system itself that creates this extracurricular gap.

The article by [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/01/the-activity-gap/384961/) shows that this is a funding issue. State budget cuts force certain districts to reduce spending, and the first costs cut are for extracurricular activities. This means parents are required to pay amounts that make the difference between a kid joining a club or not. Therefore, it is extremely important to develop programs that help students finance their extracurricular activities or support existing ones, like [ámaxa](https://www.amaxaimpact.org/), since it is such a crucial part of their personal development.

This is particularly important given that, in the US, the largest poverty rates are among African Americans and Hispanics, two minority who also encounter discrimination. Providing accessible opportunities for those students means diverse groups can become more actively engaged in the political, economic, and social aspects of society.

At ámaxa, we focus on finding ways to help our students create a meaningful and tangible impact locally or abroad by collaborating with amazing nonprofits that have a great track record.
