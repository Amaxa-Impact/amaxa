## Why is education important?
Do you remember learning how to read? Your kindergarten teacher was tasked with a huge responsibility: teaching you how to read. Starting with your ABCs, then words, small sentences, and now books, your education has taught you the most valuable skill in the entire world: reading. Reading tells you which direction to turn your car on the way to school, what to order on a restaurant menu, which assignment your teacher is asking you to complete tonight, and which brand of food you should buy for your family pet. Twenty percent of adults in the US are illiterate, meaning they cannot read, and therefore do not get to do all these things that may seem simple to you.

Education helps people become better, well-functioning citizens, get higher paying jobs, and learn about hard work, rewards, and morality. Without access to a good education, students will never learn to read, problem solve, or exist in modern day societies. Education creates so many opportunities for every person: the opportunity to earn money, raise a family, give back to your community, and create a happy and prosperous life.

## What is education inequity?
Have you ever taken a standardized test? Have you started preparing for your SATs? Have you started sending in any college applications? Each of these markers help the government determine your school's rating.

Rating systems vary depending on which state you live in, but most states have similar grading scales:

- Reading, writing, and science standardized test scores
- Teacher-to-student ratio and average class sizes
- School facilities: dining, sports, music, extracurricular activities
- The cost per student enrolled in school
- Graduation rates
- College acceptance rates

When standardized test scores at a specific school are high and a sizable percentage of the senior class gets into college, the government assigns a high rating to that school. Highly rated schools are given more money and resources from the government. Schools with lower test scores and less college acceptances are rated lowly, and therefore allocated less money and resources. That may seem a little backwards, but it is true. Lower rated schools need more help, but they receive less resources. Schools that cater to marginalized communities are most affected by this, and socio-economic class has been deemed the number one indicator of a successful education.

## What can you do to facilitate learning?
One of the key issues with low-income schools is the lack of educational resources needed to meet the demands of the students in the school. Commonly, when a student is falling behind in class, low-income public schools do not have the money to hire private tutors or pay teachers to stay late with students after school. However, there are countless opportunities for high school students to volunteer by tutoring students that need a little extra help! Being a tutor for low-income schools is a terrific way to gain volunteer experience and help students who might be struggling in class.

If interested, there are opportunities to become a tutor anywhere in the United States: New York City [Reading Partners](https://readingpartners.org/location/new-york-city/), Los Angeles [KYC](https://www.kyccla.org/services/youth-services/high-school/), Chicago [By the Hand](https://bythehand.org/volunteer/), Houston [Boys & Girls Clubs](https://www.bgcgh.org/volunteers/?utm_source=teenlife), Phoenix [City of Phoenix](https://www.phoenix.gov/education/experience), Remote [World Family Children](https://www.worldfamilychildren.org/become-a-volunteer), and more!

## Volunteer to Feed Students
Another issue facing low-income schools is that there is not always enough money to provide free breakfast and lunch for students who need it. It is impossible to learn on an empty stomach. An empty stomach causes poor understanding of new topics and a big drop in comprehension. Around 1 in 8 students go to school hungry every morning due to a lack of resources and money to purchase food. Human bodies need energy to make it through the school day and retain information, and without food, students will not comprehend most of the material in their classes. However, there are numerous volunteer positions available for high school students to help collect food for these children! Feeding America [volunteer](https://www.feedingamerica.org/take-action/volunteer) is a non-profit company located all over the states: they are always looking for motivated and driven high school volunteers to help feed hungry students. There are also food banks located in [Philadelphia](https://www.cradlestocrayons.org/philadelphia/take-action/volunteer/in-the-giving-factory/), [Atlanta](https://www.acfb.org/how-we-work/), [Orlando](https://www.feedhopenow.org/site/SPageServer/;jsessionid=00000000.app30058b?NONCE_TOKEN=91BF68CB1F44686029B18E60E40BB53C&pagename=how_help_kids), and countless other cities.

## Volunteer at Book Banks
Many children who are struggling in school look for ways to improve their education and take matters into their own hands. The best way to do this is by providing books for young students. Low-income schools sometimes lack a full and enriching library, which can lessen the students' interests in reading and books. When children start reading at an early age, it can have amazing and unparalleled effects on their life in the future.

1. Reading improves brain development by forming connections in the brain that will lead to healthy brain functions that will last a lifetime.
2. A love of reading leads to a love of learning because the attitudes students develop about reading and learning overlap and carry over into adulthood.
3. Reading has a positive effect on parent-child bonding because it offers opportunities for parents and children to bond over educational topics, and it establishes a safe and nurturing space to share new learning experiences together.
4. Reading leads to improved communication skills because young readers develop better language and grammar skills. Also, books teach children to ask questions, learn from the answers, and explore ideas from multiple perspectives.
5. Reading promotes self-confidence and creativity because reading presents children with a challenge, while also teaching them skills they can use to overcome it. Books also give children an imaginative space to develop their creativity and problem-solving skills.
6. Early reading encourages a child's independence because reading inspires young people to make their own choices and cultivate their own unique interests that may differ from their parents, siblings, or friends.

Since there are so many positives to getting young students interested in reading, an amazing volunteer opportunity for high school students is to help at book banks or free libraries. The best way to get students interested in books is for them to be around books and other kids who are fascinated with the art of reading. However, because low-income schools sometimes lack a full library, the only books kids get to read are those donated to the school. Luckily, there are a myriad of high school volunteer opportunities to collect book donations and deliver them to schools in need.

Book bank opportunities vary depending on the city you live in; however, you can always host your own book drive for underprivileged students with [Book Worm Global](https://bookwormglobal.com/volunteers). This company assists with all the preparations to plan, execute, and host a book drive. Once the drive is complete, the volunteer can coordinate with [Book Worm Global](https://bookwormglobal.com/volunteers) to choose a place for the books to be donated. This could be a low-income school, a women and children shelter, an after-school daycare, or any other place in need of books! This company has over 150,000 volunteers, and they are always looking for more people to add to their collection of over 130,000 donated books.

If you are interested in volunteering at a physical book bank, there are opportunities in every city, including [Cleveland](https://www.kidsbookbank.org/volunteer/), [Portland](https://www.childrensbookbank.org/bvolunteer-opportunities), [Baltimore](https://www.mdbookbank.org/volunteer), [Atlanta](https://thebbf.org/contacts/), [San Francisco](https://www.childrensbookproject.org/get-involved/), [Chicago](https://www.berniesbookbank.org/volunteer/), and more.

## Other Ways to Volunteer
Signing up to be a tutor at low-income schools, helping at food banks, and assisting with book drives is a wonderful way to help with education inequity, but if none of those choices feel right for you, there are many other ways to get involved! Volunteering at a low-income school in your community is the perfect place to start. You can assist with organizing materials, fundraising to raise money for school supplies, and being an assistant in the classroom. Your education has made you the person you are today, and volunteering at a school near you is just one way you can give back to the school system and help lessen education inequity.
