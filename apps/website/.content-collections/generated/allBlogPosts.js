Civilians in Palestine are being killed, displaced, and deprived of their basic rights.\n\nOne of those rights that was seized from them is the right to education. Students and teachers risk tear gas, raids, armed clashes, arrest, and intimidation just by going to school.\n\nBut amidst this turmoil there is a glimmer of hope. The ISNAD Community Education Center gives students the opportunity to learn by doing through field trips, summer camps, and extracurricular activities. This gives students a place where they can find respite and learn.\n\n## **The War’s Impact On Education**\n\nBeyond the staggering statistics of attacks on Palestinian people lies an often-overlooked casualty—education. When Palestinians struggle everyday to survive, education is easily overlooked. The occupation’s ripple effects extend into the very fabric of how students and teachers engage with education.\n\nMany times students and teachers have to choose between safety and education. Between 2015 and 2019, over 4,000 Palestinian students and educators were reportedly harmed by attacks – the highest number of worldwide attacks during the period (GCPEA). These attacks, all occurring near schools, include armed clashes, the use of tear gas, raids, checkpoints near schools, settler violence, and arrest and intimidation of children and teachers.\n\n### The Occupation’s Impact on Students\n\nArrests, demolitions, and violence are all horrifically traumatizing experiences that Palestinians are forced to endure. When students regularly regulate trauma their minds are somewhere else instead of the classroom. Persistent memories of incidents can impede the students’ ability to focus on the content and engage in the classroom.\n\nFor students who arrive at school in spite of Israeli-imposed obstacles, they encounter an ever-increasing ratio of students to teachers due to students only being able to attend their local schools. Trauma, coupled with a large student to teacher ratio, makes school an overwhelming, not fun, experience for students.\n\n### The Occupations Impact on Teachers\n\nThis barrage of challenges makes teaching distracted students a challenge. Teachers have to focus on teaching the bare minimum content of the textbook to simply get through a course. They have limited opportunities to use a variety of methods, such as discussion, collaborative work, and project-based activities.\n\nThese are the activities that make school fun and the material memorable. By only teaching by the textbook teachers can feel demotivated to teach, which can lead to poorer teaching experiences.\n\n## The Need For Experiential Learning For Palestinian Students\n\nStudents remember best when they learn by doing, also known as experiential learning. Field trips, discussions, projects, lab experiments, volunteering, and internships all create experiences students will forever remember, hence the name experiential learning.\n\nStudents develop leadership, confidence, cultural awareness, decision-making, organization, civic engagement, and more essential life skills when they engage in experiential learning. Experiential learning not only helps the students remember school material, but teaches them essential life skills.\n\n### ISNAD provides experimental learning opportunities\n\nAmidst all of the struggles of education in Palestine there’s an organization providing much needed experiential learning opportunities for students. ISNAD Community Education Center in Dahria enhances youth engagement by organizing voluntary initiatives, field trips, summer camps, and courses in languages, arts, and more not available in local schools. This\n\n### In-Person Experiential Learning Palestine Project\n\nAt ISNAD, qualified teachers provide a variety of learning opportunities for students. Students expand their educational abilities through classes in areas like languages, social media, planning, and arts. Students also participate in various volunteer projects and interventions in their local community.\n\nISNAD has organized more than 15 field trips since its founding just over three years ago. On these trips students can feel they are explorers, free to journey to an unknown site and take in all it has to teach them. For many, due to Israeli restrictions on movement, this is a feeling they have never experienced before.\n\n### Online Experiential Learning Project in Palestine\n\nCheckpoints and unreasonable permit regulations restrict students from meeting with others from outside their cities. At the same time, the occupation makes it very difficult for international visitors to enter Palestine. As a result Palestinians have very few opportunities to meet, conversate with, and learn from people from outside Palestine.\n\nThrough INSAD, Palestinians practice their English with volunteers from all over the world. They engage in conversations about food, music, film, pop culture, dress, traditions, and holidays. Through these activities English shifts from a bore to a lively exchange of ideas and experiences\n\n## How Do I Help Palestine?\n\nPalestine is hurting. Innocent people cannot live the lives they want to live. Though you cannot end the situation you can still aid those in need through various organizations.\n\n### Volunteer With Amaxa\n\nYou can aid INSAD directly through Amaxa. When you join Amaxa you and a team of other volunteers (led by a trained coach) will have the opportunity to organize online experiential learning events for students.\n\nHere’s some of the ways Amaxa volunteers have helped INSAD:\n\n- Created a free, interactive educational website for Palestinian students.\n- Mobilized volunteers and academics to contribute to the project by pre-recording (Insert number here) lessons.\n- Provided students with the opportunity to interact with different subjects and materials.\n\nInterested?

In times of peace they provide education and economic development programs.\n\nIn Palestine specifically they have built nearly 450 infrastructure projects, gave 187,770 people access to water, and have completed 53 overall projects that have improved the lives of 421,921 Palestinians.\n\nYou can directly benefit Palestinians by donating to ANERA.\n\n### Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund\n\nAnother great way to help Palestine is donating to the Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund. They impact the lives of injured and ill children in Palestine by providing much-needed medical care.\n\nThey’ve sent 2,000 affected children abroad for free medical care, sent thousands of international doctors and nurses to provide tens of thousands of children free medical care in Palestine, and provided tens of thousands of children humanitarian aid and support they can’t normally get.\n\n### Gaza Sky Geeks\n\nGaza Sky Geeks provides 4 ways to help Palestine: hiring Palestinians, volunteering skills, sponsoring, and donating. They focus on giving Palestinians world-class resources to work in tech.\n\n### Weather it’s your money or time you want to donate, there are plentiful opportunities to help those in need in Palestine",
