# Validation Standards

## ARKTYPE

- Implement validation using arktype for schema validation.
- We use arktype everywhere because it's the basis of our validation system.
- Note this isn't the case for convex, we have the use convex validators for this.
- Try and centralize things in `/packages/validators` when possible.
